# Introduction to Quantum Information

## 1. Background

Electormagnetism: 19th century --> Quantum Theory
Computing Information: 20th century --> Quantum Information
IT Industry: 21st century --> Quantum IT Industry

### Quantum Theory

- State
- Dynamics
- Measurement
- Observables

The future is Quantum IT Industry. How long will this take ?

### Quantum advantages

Computing Speedup (efficiency):

- Quantum DB Search: from O(N) to O(sqrt(N))
- Quantum prime numbers factorization

Communication:

- Security
- Capacities (efficiency)

## 2. Simple Quantum Experiment

- Initial State: starting pysical state of the system
- Dynamics: evolution of the system in time
- Final State: resulting state when the given time has passed


When analysing a physics system, like the movement of a given particule in
space:

- "classical" mechanics: If the initial conditions are known the outcome (the
	final state) is perfectly predictable, classical dynamics are simply
	applied.

- quantum mechanics: After applying dynamics there needs to be a measurement
	to know the final state of the system. All we know from quantum dynamics are
	probabilities. There are "detectors" that can record certain events and the
	dynamics tell us the probabilities of each of them to do so. If there are
	two detectors, then we have two probabilities: P0 and P1.
	state -> dynamics -> measurement -> observable

expectation of function f with respect to P: <f>P = Ei fi pi (observable)

After measurement, if there are two detectors, the information is a simple
classical bit (0 or 1). However before it, the state and dynamics cannot be seen
directly so it is "quantum". It is a quantum bit.

The quantum mechanics logic shares a lot of similarities with information
processing. The state is preperation, the transmission is the dynamics,
detection is measurement and interpretation is the observable (estimations,
probabilities, etc..).

The dynamics is the process applied to the initial state (after initialization).
This can be a quantum circuit or quantum gates. Then we have S1, S2, etc...
which are the measurement

Hilbert Space ? This is for the initialization process, where the initioal qbits
are given values (that do not give information about the result!!!). I Dont know
what that is.
outcomes. From there we can make some interpretations.
