- script building token program et deploying it on chain (add an option to make
  it a local, devnet or mainnet deployment) [use hello-solana "native" directory
  to create the deploy script, and maybe change the language because TS yuck]
- write script installing needed deps (at least solana CLI and rust/cargo)
- copy the actual token program (remove everything thats not needed ? or maybe
  use the token program as a lib ? I dont know... think about this)
